# Sprint 10 Review
### Ethan Bores
1. Issue(s) completed
Issue #57: Search solutions page is its own page
Issue #58: Click Here Routed Page Shows "All Vendors"
2. What went well
Changing the general solutions page title was a relatively easy fix to pull off.
3. What didn't go so well
Attempting to implement a page location hash for the search results page, and then parsing the hash in order to present a title which reads "Search Results" proved to be more difficult that I had anticipated.
4. What I have learned
I have learned how to read data from a URL in order to feed the aforementioned data into functions.
5. What still puzzles me
I am still puzzled by using RegEx to parse data from URLs for efficiently.
6. What will we change to improve
I plan to study RegEx more in-depth to enhance my abilities in the problematic areas I had encountered in this sprint.
