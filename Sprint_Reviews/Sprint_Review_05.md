# Sprint 5 Review
### Ethan Bores
1. Issue(s) completed
Issue #28: Improve scaling for "Commercial Marketplace" text on homepage
Issue #29: Realign center of search bar with the bottom of the background
2. What went well
Handing text resizing and maintaining a consistent place on the homepage for the "Commercial Marketplace" text went well for me.
3. What didn't go so well
I spent slightly more time attempting to align the search bar with the bottom of the background, but still accomplished the task in a relatively short time in comparison to that of my issues of previous sprints.
4. What I have learned
I have learned how to better use CSS to add responsiveness to websites, as well as becoming better at cleaning up my code.
5. What still puzzles me
I am still puzzled by the implementation of MUI to create better responsive UI.
6. What will we change to improve
To improve, I plan to study documentation of MUI and possibly refactor my code to incorporate it for improved efficiency.
