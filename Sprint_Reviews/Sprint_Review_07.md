# Sprint 7 Review
### Ethan Bores
1. Issue(s) completed
Issue #43: Solutions Page Styling
2. What went well
Tweaking the styling in both JS and CSS files went well. My understanding of how these types of files work together has noticeably improved.
3. What didn't go so well
Attempting to properly layer elements was somewhat difficult, but this was still overcame by using various alternate methods such as 'z-layering.'
4. What I have learned
I've learned more styling tags and how they work to make improvements in the aesthetics of a website.
5. What still puzzles me
I am still struggling with layering elements so that they do not affect the position or view of other elements.
6. What will we change to improve
To improve, I plan to further research other more reliable methods of layering elements rather than just the ones I used in this sprint.
