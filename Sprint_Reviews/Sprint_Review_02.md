# Sprint 2 Review
### Ethan Bores
1. Issue(s) completed
Issue #10 Add Background Image.
2. What went well
Completing my issue went a good deal more smoothly than my past issue since I have a better understanding of both Javascript and HTML.
3. What didn't go so well
Due to a slight miscommunication, I made the mistake of beginning work on other areas of the website which my teammates were already working on.
4. What I have learned
I've learned how to source and import images into websites via Javascript and how to improve upon existing styling.
5. What still puzzles me
I am still slightly puzzled by formatting and properly aligning different objects in Javascript.
6. What will we change to improve
I believe that I, personally, should improve upon my communication skills in order to avoid the aforementioned mistakes.
