# Sprint 1 Review
### Shane Tobar
1. Issues completed
Issue #9 Restructuring home page components. Completed Issue #12 Reformat Search bar as well.
2. What went well
I am gaining a lot of css and styling experience. We are moving somewhat fast and are ready to begin the next page.
3. What didn't go so well
Way issues are made can lead to weird design choices that add work, needs to be changed for next sprint
4. What I have learned
I have learned quite a bit more about css and jss now. Enjoying learning more about architecture and project planning.
5. What still puzzles me
Overlapping of flex elements. Also where next steps will be in regards to back-end development as this project is almost entirely front-end.
6. What will we change to improve
Better understanding of how to complete and design issues. Hopefully completing issues ahead of time which can be done with stronger communication.

### Gregory Bowles
1. Issue completed 
Issue #3(open) of setting up a navagation bar of products available to the customers. Time spent on task 4hrs (Add Categories of products)
2. What went well: 
Clarification on our goals has been the biggest help so far in making the next step forward. I believe that baby steps now are going to help us with giant leaps in the near future.
3. What didn't go so well:
My initial work with react took up majority of my time as it was a bit of a learning curve for me. I am also coming to terms with how we will go about our organization of files.
4. What I have learned:
I have learned to use my resources even more so than I already have. I have learned a ton of cool react features that make web development with a group a breeze. Material UI, React, and also VS code working with gitlab for easy commiting, pushing, etc.
5. What still puzzles me:
What puzzles me most for now are just aesthetic problems and the arrow mechanics for scrolling like in our example from the wireframe.
6. What we will change to improve:
I think we will continue to improve our own internal communication skills as well as our communication with our client. It has already improved but it will continue to get better.

### Ethan Bores
1. For my personal sprint, I completed the issue "Add Loss Control Services."
2. I believe that communication within the team and between our team and Nationwide's team went well. Additionally, testing and debugging went well in my opinion.
3. My understanding of CSS and React JS was rough at first, which resulted in a longer than expected amount of time spent on my issue. It may also be noted that I initially had some trouble with setting up my IDE and environment in general.
4. I've learned the basic syntax and capabilities of CSS and React JS, and how the different file types interact with each other.
5. I am still somewhat confused about the differences between styling in Reach JS and CSS as they appear somewhat similar.
6. In the future, we plan to form a more concrete meeting schedule between our team and Nationwide's team.
