# Sprint 2 Review
### Ethan Bores
1. Issue(s) completed
Issue #10 Add Background Image.
2. What went well
Completing my issue went a good deal more smoothly than my past issue since I have a better understanding of both Javascript and HTML.
3. What didn't go so well
Due to a slight miscommunication, I made the mistake of beginning work on other areas of the website which my teammates were already working on.
4. What I have learned
I've learned how to source and import images into websites via Javascript and how to improve upon existing styling.
5. What still puzzles me
I am still slightly puzzled by formatting and properly aligning different objects in Javascript.
6. What will we change to improve
I believe that I, personally, should improve upon my communication skills in order to avoid the aforementioned mistakes.

Way issues are made can lead to weird design choices that add work, needs to be changed for next sprint

Overlapping of flex elements. Also where next steps will be in regards to back-end development as this project is almost entirely front-end.

Better understanding of how to complete and design issues. Hopefully completing issues ahead of time which can be done with stronger communication.
