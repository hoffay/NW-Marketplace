# Sprint 1 Review
### Shane Tobar
1. Issues completed
Issue #5 setting up the initial page with dependencies. Assisted 2hrs with Issue #4 (Add Loss Control Services)
2. What went well
After getting clarification from the client and getting on the same page both ways, communication with the client was strong.
They have provided help and guidance for this process.
3. What didn't go so well
There were issues with communication and dealing with a new tech stack. This created some redundancy that will have to be cleared up down the road.
4. What I have learned
I have learned quite a bit more about css and jss now. I was not familiar with Material UI components so that was new.
5. What still puzzles me
Primarily structuring these initial developments so that they are in-sync and reduce rendundancy.
6. What will we change to improve
Setting a stronger standard of version control practices and overall understanding of the React framework as well as Material-UI components
