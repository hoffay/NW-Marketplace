# Questions:

1. For my personal sprint, I completed the issue "Add Loss Control Services."
2. I believe that communication within the team and between our team and Nationwide's team went well. Additionally, testing and debugging went well in my opinion.
3. My understanding of CSS and React JS was rough at first, which resulted in a longer than expected amount of time spent on my issue. It may also be noted that I initially had some trouble with setting up my IDE and environment in general.
4. I've learned the basic syntax and capabilities of CSS and React JS, and how the different file types interact with each other.
5. I am still somewhat confused about the differences between styling in Reach JS and CSS as they appear somewhat similar.
6. In the future, we plan to form a more concrete meeting schedule between our team and Nationwide's team.
