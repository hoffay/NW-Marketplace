# Sprint 1 Review
### Shane Tobar
1. Issues completed
Issue #5 setting up the initial page with dependencies. Assisted 2hrs with Issue #4 (Add Loss Control Services)
2. What went well
After getting clarification from the client and getting on the same page both ways, communication with the client was strong.
They have provided help and guidance for this process.
3. What didn't go so well
There were issues with communication and dealing with a new tech stack. This created some redundancy that will have to be cleared up down the road.
4. What I have learned
I have learned quite a bit more about css and jss now. I was not familiar with Material UI components so that was new.
5. What still puzzles me
Primarily structuring these initial developments so that they are in-sync and reduce rendundancy.
6. What will we change to improve
Setting a stronger standard of version control practices and overall understanding of the React framework as well as Material-UI components
###Gregory Bowles
1.Issue completed 
Issue #3 of setting up a navagation bar of products available to the customers. Time spent on task 4hrs (Add Categories of products)
2. What went well: 
Clarification on our goals has been the biggest help so far in making the next step forward. I believe that baby steps now are going to help us with giant leaps in the near future.
3. What didn't go so well:
My initial work with react took up majority of my time as it was a bit of a learning curve for me. I am also coming to terms with how we will go about our organization of files.
4.What I have learned:
I have learned to use my resources even more so than I already have. I have learned a ton of cool react features that make web development with a group a breeze. Material UI, React, and also VS code working with gitlab for easy commiting, pushing, etc.
5.What still puzzles me:
What puzzles me most for now are just aesthetic problems and the arrow mechanics for scrolling like in our example from the wireframe.
6.What we will change to improve:
I think we will continue to improve our own internal communication skills as well as our communication with our client. It has already improved but it will continue to get better.
