# Sprint 3 Review
### Ethan Bores
1. Issue(s) completed
Issue #13: Add "Click here" button
Issue #19: Background image cropped
2. What went well
Adding better styling to the Loss Control Services buttons and cropping the background and adding responsiveness for window resizing went smoother than I had originally expected it to go.
3. What didn't go so well
I had trouble aligning a new button below the search bar and creating and editing the styling of the plaintext alongside it.
4. What I have learned
I have learned more about styling elements and adjusting positions; however I am still quite rusty when dealing with the latter of those two.
5. What still puzzles me
I am still puzzled by the way that CSS and JS work together to position objects on the webpage.
6. What will we change to improve
I will continue to brush up on my CSS skills by watching videos and reading tutorials about CSS.

Have the next page nearly completed and main feature of the vendors is completed.

Need to split up issues more effectively to delegate tasks better and minimize large stories.

Gained more knowledge on parsing JSON with React and using values in MUI.

Page layouts with HTML. Need more time to learn proper practices.
