# Sprint 4 Review
### Gregory Bowles
1. Issue(s) not completed
Issue #24 Add sorting of vendor cards
2. What went well
Adding menu button and changing primary characteristics
3. What didn't go so well
I have had trouble aligning the new button as well as implementing the sort functions of ascending and descending
4. What I have learned
I have learned a little more about importing react components and implementing the API's 
5. What still puzzles me
Why does a function that uses "useState" need to be capitalized
6. What will we change to improve
I will continue to work on the sort and the properties of the button
