# Sprint 4 Review
### Ethan Bores
1. Issue(s) completed
Issue #13: Add "Click here" button
Issue #19: Background image cropped
2. What went well
Adding better styling to the Loss Control Services buttons and cropping the background and adding responsiveness for window resizing went smoother than I had originally expected it to go.
3. What didn't go so well
I had trouble aligning a new button below the search bar and creating and editing the styling of the plaintext alongside it.
4. What I have learned
I have learned more about styling elements and adjusting positions; however I am still quite rusty when dealing with the latter of those two.
5. What still puzzles me
I am still puzzled by the way that CSS and JS work together to position objects on the webpage.
6. What will we change to improve
I will continue to brush up on my CSS skills by watching videos and reading tutorials about CSS.
