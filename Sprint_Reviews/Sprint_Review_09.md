# Sprint 9 Review
### Ethan Bores
1. Issue(s) completed
Issue #52: Add "Possible Solutions" text on search
Issue #53: Adjust vendor image logo location
Issue #56: Correct grammar/spelling issues
2. What went well
Tweaking the image location of the vendor logos on both the modal and the cards went smoother than I had expected.
3. What didn't go so well
Locating and correcting grammatical and spelling errors within the vendor information file proved to be more time consuming and tedious than I predicted, as there were over 3000 words to check across over 30 vendors.
4. What I have learned
I have learned about MUI arguments for styling and placement of objects within various parts of the website.
5. What still puzzles me
I am still puzzled by how to parse search queries in order to display the text on the search results page.
6. What will we change to improve
To improve, I plan to look into useParams and useQuery web hooks (as suggested by my teammate, Shane Tobar) in order to retrieve and parse the text entered into the search box.
