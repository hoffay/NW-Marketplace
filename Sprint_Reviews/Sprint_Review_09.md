### Ethan Bores
1. Issue(s) completed
Issue #46: Add category titles to solutions page
2. What went well
Developing the basic functionalities to determine what category was selected went very well for me.
3. What didn't go so well
Attempting to handle search topics proved to be difficult for me. I am currently still attempting to parse the user's search text string to be poroperly displayed.
4. What I have learned
I have learned how functions work in javascript and how to read window hashes from the URL of the current page. I have also brushed up on my MUI and CSS knowledge.
5. What still puzzles me
I am still learning how to use MUI to develop mobile responsive elements and pages for the website.
6. What will we change to improve
To improve, I plan to continue watching video courses on YouTube which teach MUI skills. I will also be reading up on the correct MUI documentation to add greater responsiveness for different devices and window sizes.
