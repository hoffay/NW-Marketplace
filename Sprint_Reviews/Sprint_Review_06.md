# Sprint 6 Review
### Ethan Bores
1. Issue(s) completed
Issue #35: Inline the click here button on home page
Issue #36: Add font uniformity
Issue #37: Match image colors to wireframe
2. What went well
Adjusting colors and fonts on the homepage went smoothly for me. Besides colors and fonts, creating more responsive font resizing relative to the size of the window using 'rem' units worked out very well after getting a feel for how the units worked.
3. What didn't go so well
Adjusting the coloring of some of the vendor cards and the searchbar was a slightly difficult task due to default MUI colors and trying to modify them.
4. What I have learned
I have learned more skills involving the use of the aforementioned 'rem' units in order to provide greater responsiveness to the website overall. This goes for other elements outside of those related to the text.
5. What still puzzles me
I am still puzzled by MUI default coloring and how to properly adjust it.
6. What will we change to improve
To improve, I plan to do more research on MUI and its implementation in the elements of the website.
